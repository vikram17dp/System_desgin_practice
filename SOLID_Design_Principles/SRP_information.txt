✅ S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
Definition

A class should have one and only one reason to change.
Meaning → each class must handle only one responsibility.

If a class is doing multiple things, changes in one responsibility can break others → violating SRP.


✅ Correct SRP Implementation

Break responsibilities into separate classes:

1. ShoppingCart → holds items & calculates total
2. InvoicePrinter → prints invoice
3. CartDBStorage → saves to DB
4. Product → data object
